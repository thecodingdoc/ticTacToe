# ticTacToe
Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation in Python, featuring an AI component for game strategy (using minimax) and a Genetic Algorithm implementation for optimizing these strategies. It consists of three main files:

* `ticTacToeAI.py`: Contains the main game logic and AI strategies for playing Tic-Tac-Toe.
* `ticTacToeGA.py`: Applies Genetic Algorithms to optimize Tic-Tac-Toe playing strategies.
* `ticTacToeUtils.py`: Provides utility functions supporting the game and algorithm implementations.
